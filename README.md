# Fool's Guide

A tarot card fortune telling companion for those of us who need an extra guide in life. This web application uses the classic [Rider-Waite Tarot Deck](http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/rider-waite/) to help users with answers to their pressing questions, provides daily meditative support, and comes with a glossery of the entire 72 deck of cards for those who wish to further their knowledge and understanding of Tarot. 

## Project Status

In progress. 

## Features

### Card of the Day

A simple feature that simulates the user choosing a card at random to focus their thoughts on, or take inspiration from for that day. 

### Tarot Reading 

The Reading feature allows the user to choose from a number of [spreads](https://www.learnreligions.com/tarot-card-spreads-2562807). Each spread is designed to help answer specific types of questions (ie love, career, health), which allows the user to get more precise answers to their questions. Traditional layouts, such as the Celtic Cross Spread, is also included.  

### Browse Cards 

The card browsing feature is a glossery of the cards. All 72 cards are accessible to the user, with in depth information about each card. Each card in the glossery will include: 

- Keywords relating to the card
- A summary of the story and meaning behind the card
- Important symbolic references

## Stretch Goals 

### Saved Spreads 

Eventually, users should be able to save their readings and be able to refer to them again later.
